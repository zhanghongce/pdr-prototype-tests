- use btor when possible
- when not needed, don't enunemrate model in solve

- assumptions : add to all frame ?
- array: blackbox ?
- variable set : too constrained? trial and error ?

- use init in sygus ? Yes. You must.

- fast solve using btor if model is not necessary

- over-approximation :
    drop cex that are too difficult (we may add them later if they are truly needed)
    
- synthesize new lemmas:
    don't use those that are difficult
    need to take init => ITP into consideration !

- push lemma 
   do not do that hard to non property lemma?

- lemma status tracking
